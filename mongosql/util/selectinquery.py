    # region SA 1.2, SA 1.3

    # Solution only works for 1.2 and 1.3 because it uses a bakery
    # 1.4 does not use a bakery anymore

    # The easiest way would be to just copy `SelectInLoader` and make adjustments to the code,
    # but that would require us supporting it, porting every change from SqlAlchemy.
    # We don't want that!
    # Therefore, this class is hacky, and tries to reuse as much code as possible.

    # The main method that performs all the magic is SelectInLoader._load_for_path()
    # I don't want to copy it.
    # Solution? Let's hack into it.

    # The first step is to investigate the way the query is generated.
    # 1. q = self._bakery(lambda session: session.query(...)) makes the Query
    # 2. q.add_criteria(lambda q: ...) is used to alter the query, and add all criteria
    # 3. q.add_criteria(lambda q: q.filter(in_expr.in_....)) builds the IN clause
    # 4. q._add_lazyload_options() copies some options from the original query (`context.query`) with
    # 5. (sometimes) q.add_criteria(lambda q: q.order_by()) orders by a foreign key
    # 6. In a loop, q(context.session).params(..) is invoked, for every chunk

    # Looks like we can wrap self._bakery with a wrapper which will make the query,
    # and inject our alter_query() just before it is used, in step 6.
    # How do we do it?
    # See SmartInjectorBakedQuery, or AlteringBakedQuery, or UnBakedQuery

    # when the query is built, one of the following methods is called:
    # * self._load_via_child(.., q, ...)
    # * self._load_via_parent(.., q, ...)
    # and the `q` query is the query that we can alter.
