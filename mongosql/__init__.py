"""
MongoSQL is a JSON query engine that lets you query [SqlAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
like a MongoDB database.

The main use case is the interation with the UI:
every time the UI needs some *sorting*, *filtering*, *pagination*, or to load some
*related objects*, you won't have to write a single line of repetitive code!

It will let the API user send a JSON Query Object along with the REST request,
which will control the way the result set is generated:

```javascript
$.get('/api/user?query=' + JSON.stringify({
    sort: ['first_name-'],  // sort by `first_name` DESC
    filter: { age: { $gte: 18 } },  // filter: age >= 18
    join: ['user_profile'],  // load related `user_profile`
    limit: 10,  // limit to 10 rows
}))
```

Tired of adding query parameters for pagination, filtering, sorting?
Here is the ultimate solution.

NOTE: currently, only tested with PostgreSQL.

# - Creation (i.e. save a record into DB using JSON)
# - Replacement (i.e. completely replace a record in the DB)
# - Modification (i.e. update some specific fields of a record)
