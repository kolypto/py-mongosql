# TODO: implement a Projection capable of JOINing (that also handles relationships and nested
#  properties; support dot-notation). This should be a different class, because then you can just
#  give it a different projection handler
class MongoProjection(_MongoQueryStatementBase):
    """ MongoDB projection operator.

        This operator is essentially the one that enables you to choose which fields to select
        from a query.

        Syntax in Python:

        * None: use default (include all)
        * { a: 1, b: 1 } - include only the given fields; exclude all the rest
        * { a: 0, b: 0 } - exclude the given fields; include all the rest
        * [ a, b, c ] - include only the given fields

        Supports: Columns, Properties, Hybrid Properties

        Note: if you want a projection that ONLY supports columns and does not handle properties
        at all, you've got two options:
        1. Specify model properties as `force_exclude`, and they will always be excluded
        2. Subclass, and override _get_supported_bags() with `return self.bags.columns`.
            Then, input() will validate the input against columns only, disallowing properties

        Other useful methods:
        * get_full_projection() will compile a full projection: a projection that contains every
            column of a model, mapped to 1 or 0, depending on whether the user wanted it.
        * __contains__() will test whether a column was requested by this projection operator:
            p = MongoProjection(Article).input(...)
            if 'title' in p: ...
