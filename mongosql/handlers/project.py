### Project Operation

Projection corresponds to the `SELECT` part of an SQL query.

In MongoDB terminology, *projection* is the process of selection a subset of fields from a document.

Your models have many fields, but you do not always need them all. Oftentimes, all you need is just a small number
of them. That's when you use this operation that *projects* some fields for you.

The `proj√©ct` operation lets you list the fields that you want to have in the data you get from the API endpoint.
You do this by either listing the fields that you need (called *include mode*), or listing the fields that you
*do not* need (called *exclude mode*).

The resulting data query on the back-end will only fetch the fields that you've requested, potentially saving a lot
of bandwidth.

An example of a projection would look like this:

```javascript
$.get('/api/user?query=' + JSON.stringify({
    // only include the following fields
    project: ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name'],
}))
```

#### Syntax

The Project operation supports the following syntaxes:

* Array syntax.

    Provide an array of field names to be included.
    All the rest will be excluded.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    { project: ['login', 'first_name'] }
    ```

* String syntax

    Give a list of field names, separated by whitespace.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    { project: 'login first_name' }
    ```

* Object syntax.

    Provide an object of field names mapped to either a `1` (include) or a `0` (exclude).

    Examples:

    ```javascript
    { project: { 'a': 1, 'b': 1 } } # Include specific fields. All other fields are excluded
    { project: { 'a': 0, 'b': 0 } }  # Exclude specific fields. All other fields are included
    ```

    Note that you can't intermix the two: you either use all `1`s to specify the fields you want included,
    or use all `0`s to specify the fields you want excluded.

    NOTE: One special case is a so-called *full projection*: when your projection object mentions every single property
    of a model, then you're allowed to set `1`s to some, and `0`s to others in the same object. Use wisely.

#### Fields Excluded by Default
Note that some fields that exist on the model may not be included *by default*: this is something that
back-end developers may have configured with `default_exclude` setting on the server.

You will not receive those fields unless you explicitly require them.
This may be appropriate for some field that contain a lot of data, or require some calculation.

To include those fields, you have to request them explicitly: just use their name
in the list of fields that you request.

#### Related Models
Normally, in order to load a related model (say, user's `user_profile`, or some other data related to this model),
you would use the [Join Operation](#join-operation).

However, for convenience, you can now also load related models by just giving their name in the projection,
as if it was a field. For example:

```javascript
{ project: {
    id: 1,
    name: 1,
    user_articles: 1  // the related model will be loaded
}}
```

This request will load the related `user_articles` for you.

Note that some relationships will be disabled for security reasons.

    """ MongoDB projection operator.

        This operator is essentially the one that enables you to choose which fields to select
        from a query.

        Syntax in Python:

        * None: use default (include all)
        * { a: 1, b: 1 } - include only the given fields; exclude all the rest
        * { a: 0, b: 0 } - exclude the given fields; include all the rest
        * [ a, b, c ] - include only the given fields

        Supports: Columns, Properties, Hybrid Properties, Relationships

        Note: if you want a projection that ONLY supports columns and does not handle properties
        at all, you've got two options:
        1. Specify model properties as `force_exclude`, and they will always be excluded
        2. Subclass, and override _get_supported_bags() with `return self.bags.columns`.
            Then, input() will validate the input against columns only, disallowing properties

        Other useful methods:
        * get_full_projection() will compile a full projection: a projection that contains every
            column of a model, mapped to 1 or 0, depending on whether the user wanted it.
        * __contains__() will test whether a column was requested by this projection operator:
            p = MongoProject(Article).input(...)
            if 'title' in p: ...

        Supported columns:

        * Columns
        * Hybrid properties
        * Python Propeties (`@property`)
        * Association Proxies
        * Relationships

            4. This triggers the creation of another implicit projection. An empty one.
                It will use `default_exclude` by default, and contain {'column': 0}
            5. This new projection is merge()ed into the original projection,
                and your {'column': 1} gets replaced with a default coming from elsewhere.

        By using markers on the values, we can enforce the following rule:
        real values will have priority over Default() values,
        and a merge() will never overwrite any existing value with a Default value.

        Alternatives.
        1. Teach MongoProject to keep track of default values
        2. implement a dict() which keeps track of default values in a set.
        Both of them seemed ugly. Therefore, markers.
