### Join Operation
Joining corresponds to the `LEFT JOIN` part of an SQL query (although implemented as a separate query).

In the back-end database, the data is often kept in a *normalized form*:
items of different types are kept in different places.
This means that whenever you need a related item, you'll have to explicitly request it.

The Join operation lets you load those related items.

Please keep in mind that most relationships would be disabled on the back-end because of security concerns about
exposing sensitive data. Therefore, whenever a front-end developer needs to have a relationship loaded,
it has to be manually enabled on the back-end! Please feel free to ask.

Examples follow.

#### Syntax

* Array syntax.

    In its most simple form, all you need to do is just to provide the list of names of the relationships that you
    want to have loaded:

    ```javascript
    $.get('/api/user?query=' + JSON.stringify({
        join: ['user_profile', 'user_posts'],
    }))
    ```

* String syntax.

    List of relationships, separated by whitespace:

    ```javascript
    $.get('/api/user?query=' + JSON.stringify({
        join: 'user_profile user_posts',
    }))
    ```

* Object syntax.

    This syntax offers you great flexibility: with a nested Query Object, it is now posible to apply operations
    to related entities: select just a few fields (projection), sort it, filter it, even limit it!

    The nested Query Object supports projections, sorting, filtering, even joining further relations, and
    limiting the number of related entities that are loaded!

    In this object syntax, the object is an embedded Query Object. For instance:

    ```javascript
    $.get('/api/user?query=' + JSON.stringify({
        join: {
            // Load related 'posts'
            posts: {
                filter: { rating: { $gte: 4.0 } },  // Only load posts with raing > 4.0
                sort: ['date-'],  // newest first
                skip: 0,  // first page
                limit: 100,  // 100 per page
            },

            // Load another relationship
            'comments': null,  # No specific options, just load
            }
        }
    }))
    ```

    Note that `null` can be used to load a relationship without custom querying.

        #    In this case, we will have to use a nested MongoQuery object to generate that query for us.

        # Now, how do we do it?
        # Let's consider the options.

        # 1. 𝗦𝗾𝗹𝗔𝗹𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝘆'𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: 𝗷𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱(), 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱().
        #    Obviously, it only works for relationships with no nested Query Objects:
        #    because SqlAlchemy simply cannot filter related entities!
        #    So that's our choice for scenario A: no nested query.
        # 2. 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡
        #    Select from the primary entity, and join() the related entity to it, then use contains_eager().
        #    All filters, projections, and ordering will be applied to the whole query.
        #    This approach will actually 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆:
        #    because when the primary table has nothing to JOIN to... the row is dropped.
        #    Imagine: users JOIN articles ; and there's a user with no rows in articles. Oops.
        #    So this method can't be used for loading relationships.
        # 3. 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗢𝗨𝗧𝗘𝗥 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡
        #    Use LEFT OUTER JOIN to join the related table to the primary one.
        #    This solves the issue we had with the `JOIN` case: when the primary instance has no related rows,
        #    it will still remain. It won't disappear: it will be a row of NULLs. Perfect.
        #    However, in this case there is a different issue: when there is a filter on the related entity,
        #    you cannot just put in into the WHERE clause. Because any condition in the WHERE clause will fail
        #    to match the NULLs!
        #    There may be two solutions to this problem.
        #    3.1. Put the filtering condition into the ON clause.
        #         Example:
        #           SELECT *
        #           FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN articles
        #               ON users.id = articles.author_id
        #               AND articles.rating > 0.5
        #    3.2. Put the filtering condition into the WHERE clause, OR'ed with the possibility of having a NULL row.
        #         Example:
        #           SELECT *
        #           FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN articles
        #               ON users.id = articles.author_id
        #           WHERE articles.ratikng > 0.5 OR articles.id IS NULL
        #    The limitations of this approach are:
        #    * For every row in the primary table, you may have multiple rows in the related table.
        #       This transmits more data over the socket connection, forces sqlalchemy to do deduplication,
        #       and also spoils the total number of rows: you just can't count them!
        # 3. 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆
        #    We can make the nested MongoQuery as a subquery, and join to it.
        #    The subquery will select & filter all the relevant related entities, even LIMIT them,
        #    and then our primary query can just join to it.
        #    In this case, the nested condition will be isolated inside the subquery
        #    and will not distort the results of primary query.
        #    This method is not too different from JOINing, so it was not even considered.
        # 4. 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆()
        #    One evening I was wondering at selectinload() and dreaming: if it only could support custom filtering!
        #    This wonderful method runs a second query that loads related entities ; such a beauty!
        #    What if I can alter that query, and teach it to do projections, filtering, even grouping, perhaps?
        #    That's how selectinquery() was born: a loader option that lets you customize the query.
        #    This loading strategy injects a nested MongoSql query into the one generated by selectinload(),
        #    and uses its internal machinery to load related entities.
        #    This is currently the best method available for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

        # Now, how do we load relationships?
        # It depends.
        # If there is no nested query, we don't need no custom stuff: just use the built-in sqlalchemy machinery.
        #   It will use joinedload() for one-to-one relationships;
        #   It will use selectinload() for `uselist` relationships.
        # If there is a nested query, however:
        #   It will use LEFT OUTER JOIN for one-to-one relationships
        #   It will use selectinquery() for `uselist` relationships,

            Example:

            * The number of rows in the resulting query will not be right either.
